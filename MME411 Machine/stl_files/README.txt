The files are a rough solution to the following proposed PDS:

  - Spray head must move at a constant speed of 30 cm/s in one direction for 2 m, then return to starting position as rapidly as possible
  - Must hold the spray nozzle head & payload:
    - Mass: 20kg
    - Envelope: 18 cm wide x 18 cm long x 18 cm high
    - Mounting: four-hole pattern; tapped holes in the lower 18 x 18 face
  - The positioning of the head:
    - Nozzle-payload base must be 40 cm above the top surface of the mobile carriage
  - The lifetime:
    - Solution is to operate 10^6 (1,000,000) cycles

The 'pedestal.stl' file is the part that I designed as a part of the project with the other files, 'bearing.stl', 'belt.stl', etc., being rough 3D models of specific parts. These specific parts, which were referenced in the possible design solution for the problem, can be found in the file 'parts_reference.txt'.
