Files of my work as a engineering student at Miami University

All files here are produced by me and are academic material accumulated from my time at Miami University. Files are not allowed to be reused for other academic projects as stated by most university mandated academic integrity rules.

Each set of CAD models will correspond to different classes and different projects within those courses. These will be submitted and can be accessed through separate branches and will be named according to their respective class and project.
